MVC->Model-View-Controller
-------------------------

Model:
-----
 a place to store all your business logic that deals with the actual 
data.

View:
----
 a place to store all your design logic, like HTML, and interpolating 
data values.

Controller:
-----------
 a place to store all the code that allows the application to 
work (i.e. handles an incoming request, gets the data from the model, give 
it to the view, renders the view, outputs it to the web server)
